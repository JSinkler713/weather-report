### Weather Report
An app built with React. Get the current weather, 3-day and 5-day weather report for a location by making a request to the third party 'openweatherapi'. Make your own .env fileand save your own REACT_APP_API_KEY in the environment variable to make this app work. Other than that just run ` npm i ` to install any other dependencies, and your app should run with ` npm start ` .
